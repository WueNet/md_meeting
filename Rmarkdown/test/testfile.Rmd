## How to Start

1.  You should have a working version of RStudio (From within RStudio, go to Help \> Check for Updates to install newer version of RStudio (if available).)
2.  Install and load Rmarkdown with `install.packages("Rmarkdown")` and `library(rmarkdown)`
3.  You will be asked to give some information, that information will show up in your YAML header (which is some kind of human readable non-markup format)
    -   Important: the header can tell `render()` what to output --\> html for example
4.  Toggle the visual mode if you want.

## Basics

### Flavor

Rmarkdown has not the same "flavor" as GitHub Markdown... So unfortunately you will have to use a slightly different syntax for some things. - you have to use 4 spaces to indent a list element.

### Code blocks:

-   create code-blocks as you would do in normal Markdown.
-   The difference is, that you can have actual executable code blocks in your R-Markdown file and decide if to render everything, just the results, just the plots or nothing.
-   You have to declare a language in a `{r}` curly brackets syntax for this.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
    ` ```{r, include=True, echo=False}
    # This is an R code block, which will be included in the rendered output file. 
    # ... It would not show the source code but the result/output/plot
    # ... you only need three ``` , the first one is necessary here
    # ... to escape within the actual code block.
    ` ```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# install.packages("viridis")
library(viridis)
image(volcano, col = viridis(200, option = "A"))
```

Or just some table:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# we have to add: 
source("script.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
# variables from another script
# paste(v1)
# library(tidyverse)
print(tibble(Name = v2, Grade = v1))
```

### Rendering

-   Rendering will make a pdf, TeX, HTML, notebook, ... or whatever-you-chose-file from your \*.Rmd file.

    -   You can Render from the command line (or from an R code block) with \``render(markdownfile.Rmd)`
    -   To render your current Rmd File, use the shortcut: SHIFT+command+K (macOS) or CTRL+SHIFT+K (Windows)

-   Now the Header comes in handy, we can tell it to make a Html document by writing:

        title: "testfile"
        author: "Jakob"
        date: "3/25/2021"
        output: html_document

-   you can write as md_document --\> for GitHub, or as pdf_document for GitHub

### get a TeX file

4.  

    -   For example you can use:

    ```{=html}
    <!-- -->
    ```
        title: "testfile"
        author: "Jakob"
        date: "3/25/2021"
        output:
         pdf_document:
             keep_tex: true
             citation_package: biblatex
        bibliography: bibliography.bib

### Math Block

-   as you know it from Markdown $$
    \longrightarrow c_1 + c_2*h \Sigma^{top}_{bottom}
    $$

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
